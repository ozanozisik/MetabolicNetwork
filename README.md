# Recond3DNetwork

The provided code converts Recon3D_301.mat human metabolism data obtained from Virtual Metabolic Human database (https://www.vmh.life/) to edge lists.
For genes, NCBI ID - Approved Symbol conversion is done using the file obtained from HGNC (https://www.genenames.org/).
The resulting networks are available in http://www.ndexbio.org/.
